- **MPC Tools Integration** - We use GitHub, Discord, Task Manager, PostgreSQL, and other MPC tools for collaboration
- **Memory Bank System** - Our project uses a unique documentation approach for knowledge retention

## Required Credentials

These documents outline the various credentials needed by team members, but the actual credentials are not stored in the repository. Team members will need to obtain these separately through secure channels.

Required credentials include:
- GitHub access
- Discord/Matrix access
- Task Manager access
- MPC tools credentials
- Docker Hub access (if applicable)
- Database credentials
- Admin credentials (role-dependent)

## Onboarding Process

1. Start with [index.md](index.md)
2. Read the main guide and your role-specific guide
3. Set up your development environment
4. Configure your dockerized session
5. Set up MPC tools access
6. Review the Memory Bank (`cline_docs/`)
7. Complete your first-week tasks

## Maintaining This Documentation

These onboarding documents should be kept up-to-date as the project evolves. If you make significant changes to the project that affect how new team members should onboard, please update the relevant documents.

Remember to update documentation for:
- Changes to the dockerized environment
- Updates to MPC tools integration
- New security protocols
- Changes to development workflow
- Updates to team structure

## Communication

Once onboarded, team members will communicate primarily via Discord or Matrix, with task tracking in our Task Manager system. Information on how to join these channels will be provided separately.
