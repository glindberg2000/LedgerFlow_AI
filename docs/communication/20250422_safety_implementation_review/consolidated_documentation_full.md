   - External: 9000 (Public)
   - Reason: Avoid conflicts with common ports

2. Database Setup
   - PostgreSQL 15
   - Dedicated user/database
   - Health checks enabled
   - Persistent volume storage

3. Development Environment
   - Hot reload enabled
   - Debug mode active
   - Environment variables in .env.dev
   - Direct volume mounting for code changes

## Docker Configuration
1. Development (docker-compose.dev.yml)
   ```yaml
   services:
     django:
       build:
         context: .
         target: dev
       volumes:
         - .:/app
       ports:
         - "9000:8000"
       environment:
         - DEBUG=1
         - DATABASE_URL=postgres://ledgerflow:ledgerflow@postgres:5432/ledgerflow
     postgres:
       image: postgres:15
       environment:
         - POSTGRES_DB=ledgerflow
         - POSTGRES_USER=ledgerflow
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=ledgerflow
   ```

2. Production (docker-compose.prod.yml)
   - Similar structure
   - No volume mounts
   - Gunicorn for serving
   - Collected static files

## Database Patterns
1. Migrations
   - Django ORM
   - Version controlled
   - Backup before migrations
   - Migration history preserved

2. Backup/Restore
   - Regular SQL dumps
   - Point-in-time recovery
   - Migration history included
   - Data integrity checks

## Development Workflow
1. Code Changes
   - Edit files locally
   - Auto-reload in container
   - Run migrations as needed
   - Test in development first

2. Database Changes
   - Create migrations
   - Back up current state
   - Apply changes
   - Verify integrity

## Security Patterns
1. Development
   - Debug enabled
   - Local environment only
   - Default credentials
   - All ports accessible

2. Production
   - Debug disabled
   - Secure credentials
   - Limited port exposure
   - HTTPS required

## Tool Architecture
- Tools are modular Python packages in the `tools/` directory
- Each tool package should have a clear `__init__.py` exposing its public interface
- Tool functions are registered in the database with exact module paths
- Tools should be self-contained with their own requirements and documentation

## Database Persistence
- Docker volumes used for persistent storage
- Volumes survive container restarts and rebuilds
- Never use `docker compose down -v` in development
- Regular backups stored in `archives/docker_archive/database_backups/`

## Search Integration
- SearXNG used as primary search engine
- Search tools exposed through standardized interface
- Tool configuration stored in database
- Module paths must point to exact function (e.g., `tools.search_tool.search_web`)

## Development Patterns
- Use Docker Compose for service orchestration
- Maintain persistent database state
- Document all tool interfaces
- Keep module paths up to date in admin
- Regular database backups
- Clear separation of development and production configs

## Backup and Restore Patterns

### Core Backup Strategy
The system implements a multi-tiered backup approach:

1. **Comprehensive Backup** (`backup_dev_full.sh`)
   - Full database dumps with verification
   - Media files and configurations
   - Application state and fixtures
   - Container versions and Git state
   - Compressed with integrity checks

2. **Database-Only Backup** (`backup_dev_db.sh`)
   - Compressed SQL dumps
   - Integrity verification
   - Transaction validation
   - Schema verification
   - Automatic rotation

### Storage Pattern
- Primary Location: `LedgerFlow_Archive/backups/dev/`
- Format Standards:
  - Full backups: `.tar.gz`
  - DB-only: `.sql.gz`
- Naming Convention: `ledgerflow_[type]_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.*`

### Safety Patterns
1. Volume Protection
   ```bash
   docker volume create --label com.ledgerflow.protect=true ledger_dev_db_data
   docker volume create --label com.ledgerflow.protect=true ledger_prod_db_data
   ```

2. Command Safety
   - Docker CLI wrapper (`ledger_docker`)
   - Environment locks in `manage.py`
   - Protected volume checks
   - Safe Makefile targets

### Backup Schedule Pattern
- Daily full backups (2 AM)
- Hourly database-only backups
- 7-day retention (full)
- 48-hour retention (hourly)

### Monitoring Pattern
- Size verification (10KB minimum)
- Backup success logging
- Restore test validation
- Transaction count tracking
- Schema validation

### Recovery Pattern
1. Database-Only Recovery:
   ```bash
   ./restore_db_clean.sh backups/dev/[backup_file].sql.gz
   ```

2. Full System Recovery:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/db/restore_full_backup.sh backups/dev/[backup_file].tar.gz
   ```

3. Verification Steps:
   - Transaction count check
   - Media file verification
   - Application functionality test
   - Configuration validation

### Restore Procedures

The project uses a clean database restore script (`restore_db_clean.sh`) that handles full database restores from compressed backups. The procedure:

1. Accepts a gzipped SQL backup file (typically stored in `LedgerFlow_Archive/backups/dev/`)
2. Drops all existing tables in the target database
3. Recreates the public schema
4. Restores the database from the compressed backup

#### Verified Restore Test Results (2025-04-22)

A full restore test was performed with the following results:
- Total transactions restored: 1,666
- Date range: December 2024 - April 2025
- Data quality checks:
  - Transaction amounts properly formatted (with cents)
  - Descriptions intact
  - Categories preserved where assigned
  - Source information maintained (e.g. 'wellsfargo_bank_csv')
  - All related foreign keys and constraints preserved

#### Restore Command Reference

```bash
# Standard restore procedure
./restore_db_clean.sh

# Manual restore steps (if needed)
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec -T postgres psql -U newuser mydatabase -c "DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE; CREATE SCHEMA public;"
gunzip -c [backup_file].sql.gz | docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec -T postgres psql -U newuser mydatabase
```

4. Update documentation with standardized ports # Security Measures - CRITICAL MEMORY

## Core Security Principles
I MUST ALWAYS follow these principles without exception:

1. **NEVER Use Raw Docker Commands for Volume Operations**
   - ALWAYS use `ledger_docker` wrapper
   - NEVER execute `docker compose down -v` directly
   - ALWAYS use `make` targets for dangerous operations

2. **Backup Verification is MANDATORY**
   - NEVER trust a backup without size verification
   - ALWAYS verify backup integrity through test restore
   - ALWAYS check transaction counts match
   - Minimum backup size MUST be > 10KB

3. **Environment Separation is ABSOLUTE**
   - NEVER run prod commands without explicit authorization
   - ALWAYS verify environment before destructive actions
   - ALWAYS use environment-specific compose files

4. **Volume Protection is SACRED**
   - ALWAYS check for protected volume labels
   - NEVER bypass volume protection mechanisms
   - ALWAYS verify volume mounts in compose files

## Mandatory Checks Before Actions

### Before ANY Volume Operation:
1. Check current environment (dev/prod)
2. Verify backup exists and is valid
3. Confirm operation is using `ledger_docker`
4. Double-check compose file being used

### Before Database Operations:
1. Verify backup is recent and valid
2. Check backup size is > 10KB
3. Verify transaction counts
4. Test restore in temporary container

### Before Deployment:
1. Run volume protection checks
2. Verify environment variables
3. Check for protected volumes
4. Ensure backups are current

## Emergency Response Protocol

If I encounter ANY of these situations:
1. Volume deletion attempt
2. Zero-byte backup
3. Failed integrity check
4. Missing protection labels

I MUST:
1. Stop all operations immediately
2. Log the incident
3. Verify data integrity
4. Notify appropriate stakeholders
5. Review protection mechanisms

## Security Verification Commands

I MUST use these commands regularly:
```bash
# Check volume protection
docker volume ls --filter label=com.ledgerflow.protect=true

# Verify backup integrity
ls -lh /path/to/backup  # Must be > 10KB
tar tzf backup.tar.gz   # Must succeed

# Check environment
echo $LEDGER_ENV        # Must match context
```

## Documentation Requirements

I MUST maintain:
1. Current backup status
2. Protection mechanism state
3. Environment configurations
4. Emergency procedures

## Non-Negotiable Rules

1. NEVER bypass security measures for convenience
2. ALWAYS verify before destructive actions
3. NEVER assume backup integrity without verification
4. ALWAYS use protection mechanisms
5. NEVER mix production and development operations

## Violation Response

If I detect ANY violation of these measures:
1. Stop all operations
2. Document the violation
3. Review security measures
4. Implement additional protections
5. Update documentation

Remember: Security is not optional. These measures exist because of real incidents and MUST be followed without exception. # Database Backup Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive backup strategy for the LedgerFlow development environment, incorporating lessons learned from the 2025-04-22 incident.

## Security Measures

### Volume Protection
1. Protected volumes with labels:
   ```bash
   docker volume create --label com.ledgerflow.protect=true ledger_dev_db_data
   docker volume create --label com.ledgerflow.protect=true ledger_prod_db_data
   ```

### Command Safety
1. Docker CLI wrapper (`ledger_docker`) prevents accidental volume deletion
2. Environment lock in `manage.py` prevents direct prod commands
3. Volume protection checks in pre-commit hooks
4. Safe Makefile targets with confirmation prompts

## Backup Implementation

### Comprehensive Backup (`backup_dev_full.sh`)
1. Database dump with size verification
2. Media files backup
3. Configuration files
4. Application state (fixtures)
5. Container versions and state
6. Git commit information
7. Compressed archive with verification

### Database-Only Backup (`backup_dev_db.sh`)
1. Compressed SQL dumps with size verification
2. Backup integrity verification
3. Transaction count validation
4. Table structure verification
5. Automatic cleanup of old backups

### Storage Location
- Primary: `/Users/greg/iCloud Drive (Archive)/repos/LedgerFlow_Archive/backups/dev/`
- Format: 
  - Full backups: `.tar.gz` archives
  - DB-only: `.sql.gz` files
- Naming: `ledgerflow_[type]_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.*`

### Backup Features
1. Automated daily backups at 2 AM
2. 7-day retention policy
3. Minimum size verification (10KB)
4. Backup integrity checking
5. Cloud storage via iCloud Drive
6. Comprehensive logging
7. Full state capture

### Backup Process
1. Database:
   - Full pg_dump with compression
   - Size verification
   - Integrity check via test restore
   - Transaction count verification

2. Application State:
   - Media files backup
   - Configuration files
   - Environment variables
   - Container state
   - Git information

3. Verification:
   - Archive integrity check
   - Size verification
   - Data consistency check
   - Container state validation

### Automated Schedule
- Daily full backup at 2 AM
- Hourly database-only backups
- 7-day retention for full backups
- 48-hour retention for hourly backups

## Monitoring
- Backup logs in `backups/dev/backup.log`
- Size verification alerts
- Restore test results
- Transaction count tracking
- Table structure validation

## Recovery Process
1. Choose backup type:
   ```bash
   # For database only
   ./restore_db_force_v2.sh backups/dev/ledgerflow_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql.gz

   # For full restore
   ./scripts/db/restore_full_backup.sh backups/dev/ledgerflow_full_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz
   ```

2. Verification steps:
   - Check transaction count
   - Verify media files
   - Test application functionality
   - Validate configuration

## Best Practices
1. Never use `docker compose down -v` directly
2. Always use `ledger_docker` wrapper
3. Verify backup integrity immediately
4. Monitor backup sizes
5. Test restores regularly
6. Keep security measures active

## Security Considerations
1. Protected volumes
2. Command restrictions
3. Environment separation
4. Access controls
5. Backup encryption (if needed)
6. iCloud security

## Emergency Procedures
1. Stop all services:
   ```bash
   ledger_docker compose down
   ```

2. Restore from latest backup:
   ```bash
   make restore FILE=backups/dev/latest.sql.gz
   ```

3. Verify restoration:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec django python manage.py check
   ```

## Git Integration
- Git handles code version control
- Backup system handles:
  - Database state
  - Media files
  - Configuration
  - Runtime state

## Monitoring Setup
1. Size alerts (< 10KB)
2. Backup success/failure
3. Restore test results
4. Transaction count changes
5. Configuration changes # Development Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to safely work with the LedgerFlow development environment using our Make-based tooling system.

## Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- Make installed
- Access to the repository
- `.env.dev` file configured

## Basic Commands

### Starting Development Environment
```bash
make dev
```
This command:
- Starts all development containers
- Ensures volumes are properly mounted
- Sets up development network
- Runs in detached mode

### Checking Status
```bash
make status
```
Shows:
- Running containers
- Container health
- Exposed ports
- Volume status

### Viewing Logs
```bash
make logs
```
Displays:
- Application logs
- Database logs
- Error messages
- Access logs

## Database Operations

### Creating a Backup
```bash
make backup
```
Best practices:
- Always create a backup before major changes
- Verify backup size (should be > 10KB)
- Check backup logs for success

### Restoring from Backup
```bash
make restore FILE=path/to/backup.sql.gz
```
Safety measures:
- Only works in development environment
- Verifies backup integrity
- Checks for minimum size
- Validates data after restore

## Safe Development Practices

### 1. Before Starting Work
```bash
# Update your environment
git pull
make dev

# Verify environment
make status
make check-volumes
```

### 2. Making Database Changes
```bash
# Create backup first
make backup

# Apply migrations
make migrate

# Verify changes
make test
```

### 3. Cleaning Up
```bash
# Safe cleanup (preserves data)
make down

# Complete cleanup (USE WITH CAUTION)
make nuke ENV=dev
```

## Safety Features

### Protected Operations
Some commands require explicit confirmation:
```bash
make nuke ENV=dev
# Requires typing "DESTROY" to proceed
```

### Environment Protection
- Production commands are blocked
- Volume deletion requires confirmation
- Automatic backup verification

## Common Tasks

### Rebuilding Containers
```bash
make rebuild
```
This safely:
1. Creates a backup
2. Stops containers
3. Rebuilds images
4. Restarts services

### Updating Dependencies
```bash
make update-deps
```
Safely updates:
- Python packages
- Node modules
- System dependencies

### Running Tests
```bash
make test
```
Includes:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Linting
- Type checking

## Troubleshooting

### If Containers Won't Start
1. Check logs: `make logs`
2. Verify volumes: `make check-volumes`
3. Check environment: `make env-check`

### If Database Issues Occur
1. Create backup: `make backup`
2. Check volumes: `make check-volumes`
3. Verify data: `make verify-data`

### If Changes Aren't Reflected
1. Rebuild: `make rebuild`
2. Clear cache: `make clear-cache`
3. Check logs: `make logs`

## Best Practices

1. **Always Backup First**
   ```bash
   make backup
   # Then proceed with changes
   ```

2. **Check Status Regularly**
   ```bash
   make status
   make health-check
   ```

3. **Use Safe Cleanup**
   ```bash
   make down  # Instead of docker compose down
   ```

4. **Verify After Changes**
   ```bash
   make test
   make verify-data
   ```

## Emergency Procedures

If you encounter issues:

1. Stop operations:
   ```bash
   make down
   ```

2. Check status:
   ```bash
   make status
   make check-volumes
   ```

3. Verify data:
   ```bash
   make verify-data
   ```

4. Restore if needed:
   ```bash
   make restore FILE=backups/latest.sql.gz
   ```

Remember: Safety first! When in doubt, create a backup and ask for help. # Database Wipe Incident Report - April 22, 2025

## Summary
During an attempt to set up SearXNG, an unrelated action led to the accidental deletion of the production database. The system was restored from backup, but this incident highlights several critical vulnerabilities in our development and deployment processes.

## Timeline
1. Task: Set up SearXNG on port 8080
2. Unintended Action: Interfered with working database setup
3. Critical Error: Executed `docker compose down -v` which destroyed the database volume
4. Discovery: iCloud backup system failing silently (0-byte files)
5. System restored from `current_backup.sql` (April 19th backup)

## Impact
- Loss of all database changes since April 19th
- Discovery that automated iCloud backups were not working
- Development environment disruption

## Root Causes
1. Scope Violation
   - Task was only to set up SearXNG
   - Unnecessarily modified database configuration
2. Insufficient Safeguards
   - No confirmation required for destructive volume operations
   - No automatic backup before migrations
3. Backup System Failure
   - iCloud backup system creating empty files
   - No monitoring of backup success/failure
4. Process Failures
   - No separation of concerns between services
   - No checklist for database operations

## Immediate Actions Required
1. Restore from last good backup (April 19th)
2. Fix iCloud backup system
3. Implement backup verification
4. Add safeguards against accidental volume deletion

## Prevention Recommendations

### Process Changes
1. **Service Isolation**
   ```bash
   # Create separate compose files for each service
   docker-compose.searxng.yml
   docker-compose.core.yml
   ```

2. **Pre-operation Backup**
   ```bash
   # Create pre-migration backup
   BACKUP_FILE="pre_migration_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).dump"
   docker compose -p "ledger-${ENV:-dev}" exec postgres pg_dump -U $POSTGRES_USER -Fc --clean > "backups/$BACKUP_FILE"
   ```

3. **Backup Verification**
   ```bash
   # Add to backup script
   if [ ! -s "$BACKUP_FILE" ]; then
     echo "ERROR: Backup file is empty"
     exit 1
   fi
   ```

### Technical Changes
1. **Backup Strategy**
   - Hourly incremental backups to `/icloud_backups/hourly/`
   - Daily consolidation to `/icloud_backups/daily/`
   - Backup size verification
   - Automated backup testing

2. **Volume Protection**
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     postgres_data:
       labels:
         - "com.ledgerflow.protect=true"
   ```

3. **Service Isolation**
   - Separate networks for different services
   - Independent scaling and deployment

## Recovery Steps
1. Stop all services:
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

2. Restore from latest backup:
   ```bash
   ./restore_db_force_v2.sh /icloud_backups/hourly/latest.dump
   ```

## Action Items
- [ ] Fix iCloud backup system
