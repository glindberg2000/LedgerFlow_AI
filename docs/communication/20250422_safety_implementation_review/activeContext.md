## Next Actions
1. Create protected volume for production database
2. Implement Docker CLI wrapper script
3. Add environment locks to manage.py
4. Set up verified backup system

## Current Focus
- Implementing robust deployment pipeline with dev/prod isolation
- Setting up automated backups with iCloud integration
- Establishing CI/CD workflow with GitHub Actions

## Recent Changes
- Development environment running with Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL 17.4 database in use (decision to maintain this version)
- Basic Docker setup with dev and prod configurations

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Update docker-compose files with project flags
2. Implement guarded destructive commands in Makefile
3. Add backup container with iCloud mount
4. Set up GitHub Actions CI pipeline

## Current Environment State
- Development containers running
- PostgreSQL 17.4 active and healthy
- Redis integration planned for Phase 2

## Active Decisions
- Maintaining PostgreSQL 17.4 instead of downgrading
- Using iCloud for backup storage
- Implementing project isolation via compose project names

## Blockers/Dependencies
None currently identified

## Notes
Last Updated: May 2025
Environment: Development
Status: Active Implementation Phase

## Current Task
Migrating the application from PDF-extractor to LedgerFlow, focusing on:
1. Setting up development environment
2. Copying necessary Django files
3. Configuring database
4. Testing the setup

## Current Status
- Successfully migrated from PDF-Extractor to LedgerFlow with new Docker-based workflow
- Created comprehensive status report for stakeholders
- Established clean project structure with proper separation of concerns
- PostgreSQL 17.4 integration with persistent storage is operational

## Current State
1. Docker Configuration
   - Development environment configured
   - PostgreSQL service defined
   - Port 9000 exposed for public access

2. Directory Structure Issues
   - Need to properly structure Django project
   - Files not copying correctly
   - Need to verify paths and permissions

3. Database
   - PostgreSQL 15 configured
   - Backup files identified
   - Need to restore data

## Next Steps
1. Complete Testing Phase
   - Finish core functionality testing
   - Validate database performance
   - Test backup/restore procedures
   - Verify tool configurations

2. Production Setup
   - Implement production deployment procedures
   - Configure SSL/TLS
   - Set up automated backups
   - Establish monitoring system

3. CI/CD Implementation
   - Set up automated testing
   - Configure deployment pipeline
   - Implement version management
   - Create release procedures

## Blockers
- Need to complete testing phase before production deployment
- Monitoring system needs to be configured
- CI/CD pipeline setup pending
- Production environment configuration needs verification

## Current Directory Structure
Clean project structure established:
- `app/` - Main application code
- `cline_docs/` - Project documentation
- `docker/` - Docker configuration
- `docs/` - Additional documentation
- `requirements/` - Python dependencies
- `tools/` - Utility tools
- Docker and environment configuration files at root

## Team Communication
- Status report created for stakeholders
- Directory structure documented and cleaned
- Migration progress tracked and documented
- Next steps and timeline established

## Technical Notes
- Using PostgreSQL 17.4 for improved performance
- Docker Compose setup with proper health checks
- Environment-specific configurations working
- Development workflow documented and tested

## Progress Indicators
