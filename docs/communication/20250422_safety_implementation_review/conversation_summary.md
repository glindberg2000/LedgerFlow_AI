Date: 2025-04-22

## Conversation Timeline

1. Initial Assessment
   - Identified duplicate containers and configuration issues
   - Reviewed current safety measures
   - Analyzed backup and restore procedures

2. Implementation Steps
   - Standardized container configuration
   - Implemented safety measures
   - Created comprehensive documentation
   - Tested restore procedures

3. Documentation Updates
   - Created Memory Bank entries
   - Updated operational guides
   - Established safety procedures
   - Created documentation index

4. Testing and Verification
   - Restored 1,666 transactions successfully
   - Verified data integrity
   - Tested safety measures
   - Validated container setup

## Key Decisions

1. Container Standardization
