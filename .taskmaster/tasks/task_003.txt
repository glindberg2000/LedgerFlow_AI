# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Authentication and Authorization System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a secure authentication system using JWT/OAuth2 with FastAPI, implementing role-based access control for admin, user, and agent roles.
# Details:
1. Set up FastAPI security dependencies using OAuth2PasswordBearer
2. Implement JWT token generation and validation
3. Create user registration, login, and password reset endpoints
4. Implement role-based permission system
5. Create middleware for role verification
6. Set up refresh token mechanism
7. Implement session management
8. Add rate limiting for auth endpoints
9. Create auth-related Pydantic schemas
10. Document authentication flow and API endpoints

# Test Strategy:
Test authentication flow with different user roles. Verify token expiration and refresh. Test permission checks for protected endpoints. Ensure proper error handling for unauthorized access attempts. Perform security testing for common vulnerabilities.
