# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Database Models with SQLAlchemy
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement database models using SQLAlchemy ORM that match or extend the legacy schema. Include models for users, roles, businesses, statements, transactions, and parser configurations.
# Details:
1. Analyze legacy database schema from documentation
2. Create SQLAlchemy Base class and database connection utilities
3. Implement User and Role models with relationships
4. Implement Business and Profile models
5. Implement Statement and Transaction models
6. Implement Parser configuration models
7. Set up Alembic for migrations
8. Create initial migration script
9. Add indexes for common query patterns
10. Document model relationships and schema design

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for model relationships and constraints. Test migrations both forward and backward. Verify compatibility with legacy data structure. Ensure proper cascade behaviors for related records.
