# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement AI/Agent Workflows for Transaction Categorization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop AI-powered workflows for automatic transaction categorization and processing.
# Details:
1. Design agent workflow architecture
2. Implement categorization algorithms
3. Set up machine learning pipeline for training
4. Create feedback mechanism for improving categorization
5. Implement confidence scoring
6. Create manual override capabilities
7. Set up batch processing for categorization
8. Implement categorization rules management
9. Create UI for reviewing AI suggestions
10. Document AI/agent capabilities and limitations

# Test Strategy:
Test categorization accuracy with various transaction types. Verify feedback mechanism improves results over time. Test performance with large transaction volumes. Verify manual overrides work correctly. Test rule-based and ML-based categorization.
