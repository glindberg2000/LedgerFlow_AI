# Title: Set Up Celery Integration with FastAPI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Celery with FastAPI for handling background tasks such as statement parsing, report generation, and other long-running processes.
# Details:
1. Configure Celery with Redis/RabbitMQ as broker
2. Create Celery worker configuration
3. Implement task result backend
4. Set up task scheduling capabilities
5. Create base task classes with error handling
6. Implement task status tracking and retrieval endpoints
7. Set up task queues with priorities
8. Create utility functions for task management
9. Implement task retry mechanisms
10. Document background job architecture

# Test Strategy:
Test task creation, execution, and result retrieval. Verify error handling and retry mechanisms. Test concurrent task execution. Ensure proper task prioritization. Verify task status updates are correctly tracked and reported.
