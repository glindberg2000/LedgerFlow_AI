# Task ID: 6
# Title: Scaffold React Frontend with Authentication
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the React frontend application with TypeScript, routing, state management, and authentication integration.
# Details:
1. Initialize React application with TypeScript
2. Set up project structure (components, pages, hooks, etc.)
3. Configure routing with React Router
4. Implement state management (Context API or Redux)
5. Create authentication context and hooks
6. Implement login, registration, and password reset forms
7. Set up protected routes based on user roles
8. Create API client with authentication headers
9. Implement token refresh logic
10. Create basic layout components and navigation

# Test Strategy:
Test authentication flows with Jest and React Testing Library. Verify protected routes redirect unauthenticated users. Test form validation and error handling. Ensure token refresh works correctly. Test responsive layout on different screen sizes.
