# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Title
Hybrid Account Number Workflow for Statement File Upload, Parsing, and Admin Review

## Background
LedgerFlow must ensure that every statement file and transaction is associated with an account number for downstream reconciliation, reporting, and deduplication. However, account number extraction is only possible for some PDFs, and is rarely available in CSVs. For privacy, masked/last-4 is preferred unless full account number is required. The system should automate extraction where possible, and prompt for manual entry only when needed.

## Goals
- Allow statement file uploads without requiring account number at upload time.
- Attempt to extract account number during parsing (PDFs where possible).
- If account number is missing after parsing, flag the file/transaction for manual entry.
- Provide admin UI to review and fill in missing account numbers (prefer masked/last-4).
- Block or warn on export/reporting if any files/transactions are missing account number.
- Clearly document and communicate limitations for CSVs and privacy best practices.

## Requirements
1. **Model Changes**
   - Add a `needs_account_number` Boolean field to `StatementFile` (and/or Transaction) to track missing account numbers.
2. **Parsing Logic**
   - Attempt to extract account number from PDFs during parsing.
   - If extraction fails or is not possible (e.g., CSVs), set `needs_account_number = True`.
   - If account number is present, set `needs_account_number = False`.
3. **Admin UI**
   - Add a filter/list in the admin for files/transactions where `needs_account_number = True`.
   - Provide a form/inline to allow manual entry of account number (masked/last-4 or full).
4. **Validation**
   - Block or warn on export/reporting if any files/transactions are missing account number.
5. **Documentation**
   - Update user/admin documentation to clarify:
     - Account number is not required at upload.
     - Extraction is attempted during parsing (PDFs only).
     - Manual entry is required if extraction fails.
     - CSVs will not have account numbers unless provided externally.
     - Masked/last-4 is preferred for privacy.

## Out of Scope
- Automated account number extraction for CSVs (unless feasible in the future).
- Enforcement of full account number if masked/last-4 is sufficient for business needs.

## Success Criteria
- All statement files and transactions have an account number (masked/last-4 or full) before export/reporting.
- Admins can easily identify and fill in missing account numbers.
- No user is blocked at upload due to missing account number.
- Privacy best practices are followed.
