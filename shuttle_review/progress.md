## [2025-06-05] Progress Update
- Added automatic transaction ID sequence sync to all bulk import/parse actions.
- Users will never see duplicate key errors due to sequence mismatch.
- No manual DB intervention is needed for normal operation.

- Unified the defaulting of payee_extraction_method across admin actions and raw imports.
- All code paths now use PAYEE_EXTRACTION_METHOD_UNPROCESSED ("None") for payee_extraction_method.
- Next: Test in UI and DB to confirm all unprocessed transactions are consistent after import or reset.

## What Works

- Batch uploader allows uploading statement files without account number.

## What's Left to Build

- Enforce account number as mandatory for parsing/processing.
- Update parsing logic to raise error if account number is missing.
- Provide UI/admin tools to add/edit account number before parsing if needed.
- Test and verify the hybrid workflow.

## Progress Status

- In progress: Implementing hybrid account number requirement (optional on upload, mandatory for parsing).

## Progress Log (as of 2024-06-27)

## What Works
- All circular references and template loader issues have been excluded.
- Minimal app_list.html (extends and empty content block) still triggers RecursionError.

## What Has Been Tried (and Excluded)
- Database and migration drift are fully excluded as causes.
- All custom content, block tags, and template logic have been removed from app_list.html.
- Circular references, template loader, and settings issues have been checked and excluded.

## What's Left to Build / Try
- Next steps may require external review or advanced debugging, as the issue appears to be a deeper Django template system bug or project-specific misconfiguration.

[2025-06-26] Wells Fargo Mastercard parser bug resolved.
- **Root cause:** Logger variable shadowing and legacy code in PDF-extractor submodule (`wellsfargo_mastercard_parser.py`).
- **Symptoms:** 'cannot access local variable logger' error in admin UI, no stack trace in logs.
- **Resolution:**
  - All logger usage now consistent (`wellsFargo_logger`), no stray `logger` references.
  - Debug prints and legacy code removed.
  - Parser is contract-compliant, robust, and documented.
  - No changes needed in main Django app.
- **Troubleshooting tip:** If similar errors occur, check parser submodules for inconsistent logger usage, legacy code, or stale bytecode.
