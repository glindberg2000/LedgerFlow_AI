# Questions for Legacy Developer

We're migrating the PDF Extractor to LedgerFlow and have a few specific questions not covered in the README:

1. **Version Requirements**
   - Are there specific version constraints for Python packages beyond what's in requirements.txt?
   - Any known version conflicts to avoid?

2. **Redis Usage**
   - What features specifically depend on Redis? 
   - Is it required for core functionality or optional for caching?

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Are there any additional env vars beyond those listed in the README that we should know about?
   - Any specific values required for development that differ from the examples?

4. **Development Workflow**
   - Any specific development tools or extensions required for local development?
   - Are there any watch scripts or development utilities we should be aware of?

Please note: We have the README with basic setup instructions - these questions are just for clarification on details not covered there.
