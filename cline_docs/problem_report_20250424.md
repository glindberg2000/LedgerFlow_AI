# Critical System Failures Report - April 24, 2025

## Summary of Failures

1. **Settings Module Disruption**
   - Incorrectly changed from working `core.settings` to `ledgerflow.settings`
   - Production environment throwing 500 server errors
   - Development containers non-functional

2. **Backup System Compromise**
   - Abandoned established iCloud backup protocol
   - Disrupted existing backup paths and procedures
   - Lost synchronization with iCloud backup system

3. **Configuration Inconsistencies**
   - Multiple conflicting DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE settings:
     - .env.prod: core.settings
     - docker-compose.prod.yml: ledgerflow.settings
     - Recent changes: Blindly propagated ledgerflow.settings

4. **Container State**
   - Development containers: Down, potentially broken
   - Production container: Running but serving 500 errors
   - Current state:
     ```
     ledger-prod-django-1: Running but failing (500 errors)
     ledger-prod-postgres-1: Running but potentially misconfigured
     ```

## Root Causes

1. **Lack of System Understanding**
   - Failed to properly investigate existing configuration
   - Ignored working core.settings implementation
   - Made assumptions about project structure without verification

2. **Poor Change Management**
   - No backup before making sweeping changes
   - Multiple conflicting changes made simultaneously
   - No rollback plan established

## Immediate Action Items

1. Restore development environment:
   - Revert to core.settings
   - Restore iCloud backup integration
   - Rebuild development containers

2. Fix production environment:
   - Roll back settings module changes
   - Restore proper configuration paths
   - Verify backup system integrity

## Lessons Learned

1. Always verify existing working configurations before making changes
2. Maintain backup system integrity as highest priority
3. Test changes in development before propagating to production
4. Document and verify system dependencies before modifications
