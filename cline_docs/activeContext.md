## 2024-04-25 Major Cleanup and Codebase Confirmation

- Moved legacy/duplicate app folders (`app/ledgerflow`, `app/core`, `app/profiles`, `pdf_extractor_web`) to `deprecated/`.
- Deleted SQL dumps, logs, and stray files from project root.
- Moved all shell scripts to `scripts/`.
- Confirmed live dev codebase is `core/` (via docker-compose.dev.yml) and prod is `ledgerflow/` (via docker-compose.prod.yml).
- Restarted all containers (except vsc-ai-coder-bot) and verified site is up and data is available on port 9000.
- No dependency on deprecated folders for live site.

**Next step:** Reinitialize git and push to a new, clean GitHub repository.
