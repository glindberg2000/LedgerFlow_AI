## [2025-06-05] Progress Update
- Added automatic transaction ID sequence sync to all bulk import/parse actions.
- Users will never see duplicate key errors due to sequence mismatch.
- No manual DB intervention is needed for normal operation.

- Unified the defaulting of payee_extraction_method across admin actions and raw imports.
- All code paths now use PAYEE_EXTRACTION_METHOD_UNPROCESSED ("None") for payee_extraction_method.
- Next: Test in UI and DB to confirm all unprocessed transactions are consistent after import or reset.
